We used the device to introduce the idea of a local network and the possibility of a digital archive for different knowledge practices anchored by women in Bidar. One of the activities that we relied on during the project was to use these devices to engage curiosity and start conversations about the heritage of Bidar.",

They sing Kumabara padagalu (songs) and as a bhajan (devotional songs). These songs are passed on from one generation to another through oral practice. More than seeing an implementation of the network, these women are keen on recording the songs as they are not available on the Internet.",

Since most of her writings are in Urdu, access is limited not only outside but within Bidar, her locality. With Ruksaana Maâ€™am we have started to record her stories and also start the process of translating them to English.",
