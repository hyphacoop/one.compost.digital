title: Fertile Technofutures from Bidar
author: Micah Alex
description: Bidar offers a different vision for technology, unique to the city's socio-material reality. We present the vision in this piece - fractured, non-cohesive, multi-voiced and ephemeral.

titleImageAlt: A landscape map of Bidar, painted in different shades of green and yellow splotch and splat, stroke and shallow. The contours are obvious, built on a hill as the city is. The fort isn't on the page but we can almost see it, if we squint real hard and then imagine it, like the millions of people hustling and bustling on. The city city streets drawn in electric pink buzzing with life.

This piece is a group reflection of a project run in Bidar, India, to set up a community mesh network facilitated by Living Labs Network and Forum, and Janastu/Servelots. 

This local mesh network was to act as an intranet of local informal archives that would collectively function as a knowledge network. These archives come from various communities in Bidar and their knowledge practices. During the course of the project, we came to see both the limitations of technology but also the potential of it to catalyse and nurture many more spaces of cultural collaboration. 

We would like to present narratives from the field of possibilities and futures that our network members came across. The main aim of this endeavour was to set up the network as a way to to document and creatively engage with folklore, songs, and oral practices held by women of various communities in Bidar. The intent was to connect the unconnected through collaborative activities and create mutual annotation of oral knowledge practices.

## How to read this artifact

The following image has been annotated with descriptions of the projects, responses from various network members, and internal thoughts and reflections. The image is a condensed map of places, artifacts and people in these different spaces. It is an exercise in sensemaking through collecting different experiences, emotions, epiphanies and hopes in the context of the mesh. It is an abstraction of Bidar  — a small city with rich histories of diverse populations and cultures meeting.

## Why is it made this way 

It is a common gripe among researchers and activists in our area of work in India, that writing in English forces us to capture and categorise. This is a smaller effort on our part to bring out the intangible, give a glimpse into the cultural interconnections as well as account for different articulations than what a traditional format allows. During this piece, you might get lost and some things won’t make sense and you’d want to know things that aren’t explicitly said. But imagine yourself as a traveler. Please wonder and wander as you explore and listen.
