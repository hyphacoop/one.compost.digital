These gifs were inspired by _kaoani_, a pervasive, incredibly cute pixelated blob emoji that were popular in the geocities & myspace-eras of the internet. Kaoani had tons of different styles, with folks making custom versions for their own sites and forums. Variations would get lifted out and used in other places by admirers -- and because of our creative commons license, you can do that with these gifs too!
