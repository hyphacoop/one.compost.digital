Rural ecosystems are losing their voice. They are treated as passive recipients of emerging developments with their data environments fractured by infrastructural problems. The textually prolific Internet doesn’t account for other common forms of knowledge. There is a dire need to envision an inclusive platform that accommodates creation, discovery, and navigation of alternate worldviews that don’t fit into Western categorisations.

We, at Janastu, build decentralised Community Owned Wi-Fi [COW] mesh networks to provide low-cost last mile Internet connectivity in remote areas. We raise questions about technology and different learning mediums for communities, and develop hypermedia annotation tools for archival needs of communities for inclusion of low-semi literates as first-class Internet citizens, and not as next billion users2.

We have been hacking together more of an unPC: a not-so-personal computer, with a Raspberry Pi core, called the Aamne Saamne Pi 1. It is a community-owned white box laptop which facilitates the creation, discovery, and re-narration of community expressions. It also enables the use of personal devices as extensions of community-owned network devices. We introduced ASPi to a group of girls in a village called Mirzapur [Uttar Pradesh, India] as a platform to aid in social, decentralised, and divergent self learning. They were called Garima Girls — aged between 16 to 22, they are adversely affected by the pandemic and struggling against the stigma of even owning a phone on account of patriarchy.

Our primary objective was to encourage rural women, students, young women in traditional labor and skill contexts — typically low literate, as well as unconnected or unable to discover or publish useful content on the Internet — to find purposeful online communities to actively engage with for their collective needs of skill development and entrepreneurial aspirations. Our engagement was complemented by online sessions and supportive activities to spur coworking spaces, and witness emergent experimentation in rural settings rather than the prescriptive ‘training.’

With ASPi as the core artefact, we advocated for the reuse of peripherals, interconnected small communities to help sustain the vernacular narratives, and exposed them to varying alternate perspectives. ASPi empowers the marginalised communities to negotiate their traditional roles in the society, while putting their own narratives forward and participating in community knowledge building practices.

Free from the burden of addiction, abuse, opacity, and existing connotations of smartphones or laptops, ASPi is built on values of play, tinkering, openness, and access. It is designed to be affordable, easily repairable, and networked to each other as well as to the Internet. This network would be useful to foster the entrepreneurial aspirations of communities by supporting them to build small businesses. It increases their access to opportunities in numerous ways: bringing local skills together, creating and sharing hypermedia content, disseminating educational materials, exploring cyber physical systems, creating jobs around the network, regulating markets in a more decentralised way, and gathering voices and responses to various policies.
