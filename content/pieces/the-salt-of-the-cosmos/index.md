1. The Google image search for Salar de Uyuni is dazzling. The pictures are so white your eyes hurt. The spaciousness is almost terrifying. You can’t help but think that a place so full of emptiness must contain mirages: tricks of the light, secret delusions, pathways to remarkable places and incomprehensible desires. The dried up lake looks like it could go on forever and ever. Everything here is in your head.{{< footnote "Salar de Uyuni" >}}

2. Lithium (Li) is the third element on the periodic table, sitting right behind hydrogen and helium. With an atomic mass of 6.941u, the soft silver-white metal is the lightest of all the alkalis and, under ordinary conditions, floats on the surface of water.{{< footnote "Lithium and Water" >}} Naturally-occurring lithium is impure; found in magmatic rocks and mineral springs, the highly reactive raw material must be separated from its elemental counterparts in order to become useful.

3. The first lithium petalite, a transparent crystal consisting of lithium aluminium phyllosilicate, was discovered in the 19th century on a Swedish island by the Brazilian statesman and naturalist José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva. A century later, the salt compound had made its way into the growing field of modern medicine: used as an anticonvulsant and a hypnotic as well as to treat abnormal levels of uric acid in the body. In 1871, William Hammond, the military surgeon and professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous System at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York, became the first physician to prescribe lithium for psychiatric purposes. “Latterly I have used the bromide of lithium in cases of acute mania,” he wrote in his 1889 book A Treatise on the Diseases of the Nervous System. “[I] have more reason to be satisfied with it than with any other medicine calculated to diminish the amount of blood in the cerebral vessels, and to calm any nervous excitement that may be present.” {{< footnote "A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System" >}}

   Psychiatric literature from the first half of the 20th century largely erased this early history and, for over five decades, lithium was used mostly for craftwork and in machine grease.{{< footnote "Machine Grease" >}} In 1949, at a veterans’ hospital in a Melbourne suburb, the Australian psychiatrist John Cade came to be credited with reintroducing lithium as a treatment for what was then known as “manic depression.” 

   Over a few isolated studies conducted throughout the following years, the salt compound became the “gold standard” for treating manic episodes — what Cade referred to as “psychotic excitement” and a quick Google search today defines as “periods of great euphoria, delusions, and overactivity.” (An alternate definition supplied by the search engine’s language service is, simply, “an obsession.”) In a tug-of-war between scientific observation and pharmaceutical marketing, the United States stalled on trading in treatments like electroconvulsive shock therapy for lithium carbonate.{{< footnote "Lithium Underground" >}} In the 1970s, with physicians already skirting federal approval to prescribe the salt, the U.S. became the 50th country to admit lithium into the marketplace. 

4. The potential of the lithium electrode — a high working voltage that allows lithium-ion batteries to charge faster and last longer than those made from other elements — was first discovered in 1912 by American chemist, Gilbert Lewis. If lithium was initially an overlooked resource, in the decades following World War II it became increasingly strategically important.

   In a landscape of massive tech developments and loose corporate regulations, lithium mining became one of the most rapidly expanding mineral industries. China began producing the salt in the 1960s, when geologists first discovered high concentrations of it in evaporated lakes of western Tibet.{{< footnote "Kumbum Monastery" >}} In the 1970s, mining began in the “lithium triangle” — a region of the Andes which contains about 54% of the world’s reserves and spans from Bolivia’s Salar De Uyuni to Chile’s Salar de Atacama to Argentina’s Salar del Hombre Muerto and Salar de Olaroz.

   Today, lithium is bought by Tesla to run electric cars, pharmaceutical companies to flatten manic episodes, and technology manufacturers to power computers and cell phones.{{< footnote "The Big Three" >}} With a market set to surpass $60 billion USD by 2024, and international corporations spending billions a year to extract the salt, investors await the big lithium boom — a surge in stocks as the “white gold” hits the peak of its business cycle.
