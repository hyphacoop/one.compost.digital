Throughout the Pleistocene, the last geological epoch which began around 2.6 million years ago and spanned the earth’s most recent glaciations, the plateau where the Andes are the widest — the Altiplano — was covered by paleolakes which waxed and waned in temperature and size. In the wake of the most recent Ice Age, the large lakes dried up and created the salar of today: a salt crust which covers pools of brine that are rich in lithium."

Decolonization, as we know, is a historical process: that is to say that it cannot be understood, it cannot become intelligible nor clear to itself except in the exact measure that we can discern the movements which give it historical form and content. Decolonization is the meeting of two forces, opposed to each other by their very nature… ” "

While digital technologies extend and expand systems of policing AFK, they also provide creative space to refuse a binary world order. In a 2012 essay for The Society Pages, Russell explains, Glitch Feminism “embraces the causality of ‘error’, and turns the gloomy implication of glitch on its ear by acknowledging that an error in a social system that has already been disturbed by economic, racial, social, sexual, and cultural stratification and the imperialist wrecking-ball of globalization — processes that continue to enact violence on all bodies — may not, in fact, be an error at all, but rather a much-needed erratum.” The glitch — a malfunction resulting from a surplus or decay of data — is an act of un-doing; a potential “correction” to a broken machine.

    "text": "See Sylvia Wynter’s thinking about race as a determinant of who we are, and the Enlightenment’s divisions of life within the “species of human.” The direction that Wynter points us to is not to appeal to the fact that the Other is a human too but to shift to a collective grappling with new ways of being human. Reflecting on Wynter’s work earlier this year, the scholar and archivist Che Gossett explains: “Wynter makes a lateral move and offers, via her theorization of the Human as a genre, a de-hierarchization of life/subjectivities. This to me, especially in this moment of what anti-Black capitalist planetary destruction might look like, speaks to other formations and orchestrations of life that work toward new iterations of livability and inhabitability of this planet.” As queer theorist Jack Halberstam gestures in his 2020 book Wild Things: the problem is not how we relate to each other but that we relate at all. Fred Moten and Stefano Harney untangle this idea in their 2013 book The Undercommons, which interrogates the professionalization of knowledge within the academy and then seeks to carve out new forms of knowledge-making. In the introduction to Moten and Harney’s book, Halberstam notes that their project “seems crazy and impossible.” In the undercommons, crazy lends itself to oppositional solidarities that defy easy categorization."

    "text": "In a piece from her newsletter “How To Cure A Ghost,” writer Fariha Róisín provides a literary review of the colonization of knowledge. In a 2013 paper, she notes, the sociologist Ramón Grosfoguel turns to René Descartes’ famous line to suggest that Cartesian philosophy inaugurated the “ego-politics of knowledge.” The academic and philosopher, Enrique Dussel, Róisín explains, reframes Descartes’s statement to “I conquer, therefore I am.” Grosfoguel reads this appropriation to mean that “the arrogant and idolatric God-like pretension of Cartesian philosophy is coming from the perspective of someone who thinks of himself as the center of the world because he has already conquered the world.” Reflecting on both texts, Róisín writes: “I keep thinking about this, how this obsession to know all, to be right about it all, is to propagate an idea that was very much instilled by white, Christian men who wanted nothing more to dominate by erasing the possibility of anything beyond what they knew, and what they deemed to understand.” "

For Bennet, these “flows” are also always speaking to us, and each other, without using words. To tap into our elemental being, we must turn to the non-linguistic realm."
