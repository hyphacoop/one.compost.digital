    "text": "Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni is the world’s largest salt flat. Throughout the Pleistocene, the last geological epoch which began around 2.6 million years ago and spanned the earth’s most recent glaciations, the Altiplano—the plateau where the Andes are the widest—was covered by large lakes, or paleolakes, which waxed and waned in temperature and size. In the wake of the most recent Ice Age, the Holocene epoch which began 11,700 years ago and defines modern geological time, the paleolakes dried up and created the salar of today: a salt crust which covers pools of brine that are rich in lithium."

    "text": "When combined with H20, lithium fizzes into a colourless solution of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and highly flammable hydrogen gas (H2). Some studies have found naturally occurring trace levels of lithium in drinking water to be associated with significantly lowered suicide rates."
