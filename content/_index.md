# FERTILE GROUNDS

`ISSUE ONE`

Even as existing digital infrastructure fails to embolden truth or bring people together, we are hopeful. In _Fertile Grounds_ we explore how our decaying web can help new networks flourish.

This debut issue of COMPOST magazine features writing and art about technologies, protocols, and communities that enable authentic and trustful connections.
