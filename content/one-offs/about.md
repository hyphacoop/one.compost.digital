# About Us

COMPOST is a magazine about the digital commons. We curate works of art, reflections, and experiments about building the web as a shared resource and a commons with active stewards.

We see COMPOST as a process to metabolize and renew our relationships with the web, to imagine and build interdependent, equitable, and solidarity-based systems of communication and knowledge sharing.

If you like what weâ€™re doing, please consider becoming a [subscriber](https://opencollective.com/compost/contribute/backer-22573/checkout), contributing [money](https://opencollective.com/compost) (or [cryptocurrency](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1385/compost)), and support us through [Web Monetization]({{<relref "support-us#web-monetization">}}).

# Experiments with publishing

## Issues and Labs

We treat each issue of COMPOST as a lab. During the development of an issue, COMPOST contributors and the core team experiment with the design and governance of a digital commons. From December 2020 to February 2021, our Issue One cohort has been thinking about creative collaboration, collectively supporting livelihoods, and growing our community sustainably.

## A distributed press

We want creators to have more control over the means of digital publishing. We do this by building tools and testing approaches that support alternative publications.

Our sister project [Distributed Press](https://distributed.press) is an open-source publishing tool that allows COMPOST magazine to publish to web and [DWeb](https://getdweb.net) ecosystems including [Hypercore](https://hypercore-protocol.org/) and the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io), with plans to support plaintext-based distributed social networks like [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) in the near future. You can learn more about how we approach COMPOST and Distributed Press on our [Wiki](https://github.com/hyphacoop/distributed-press-organizing/wiki/About-COMPOST-and-Distributed-Press/).
